# Optimization using Linear Programming

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for solving optimization problems using linear programming techniques.

## YouTube Tutorial
For a detailed explanation on the methods and code use, please refer to the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6LjKpx2TU0&list=PLWv23ocV_hYbDKdaW7098uDwJ0O3MoUsH).

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, please create a virtual environment
